<h2><i><u>
Introduction 
</i></u></h2></font>

<p><font size=4> &nbsp;&nbsp;
My name is Kaylee Madrigal. I'm 18 years old and from Chicago, IL. I'm curretly a First Year at Mount Holyoke College. I'm a First-Gen so I have gone through lots of trial &amp; error within the college process. Both of my parents are from Michoacan, Mexico. My dad imiggrated to the states around 17 years old or even younger! I love hearing stories from my parents of when they were living in Mexico and even stories about how they immigrated to the states. </font>
</p>

<p2><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Transitioning from living in Chicago to living in Massachusetts was very hard. Although I love both environments I was not used to living in a small town. I find it very interesting how different yet similar the two places can be. I miss the city when I'm in college but then I miss the small town when I'm in the city. But mainly I miss the Mexican food my parents would make back at home. My favorite Mexican dishes are tacos de al pastor and tinga con arroz. The food at Blanch is not as good as my parents food though.

A way I've been keeping myself involved in college is by joining sports and orgs. During my first semester here I joined club Rugby. Ever since I joined I've had so much fun. Learning the rules for Rugby was very difficult! But it was very worth it. If you're reading this you should play RUGBY!!!
